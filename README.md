# Dotfiles

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains my personal dotfiles - a collection of shell configurations, tools, applications, and their settings. It's designed to provide a reproducible environment when migrating between machines and to maintain a history of my machine's configuration.

## üåü Features

- Shell configurations (Fish, Zsh)
- Nix-based package management
- Reproducible environment setup
- macOS and Linux support
- SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion) dictionary management

## üéØ Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: The codebase is kept small to ensure effective management and maintainability, reducing maintenance costs.
- **Portability**: The configuration is portable and can be used across different machines, with special attention given to ease of use in Docker containers.
- **Minimalism**: Dependencies are kept to a minimum, using only carefully selected packages.

## üîß Requirements

- [Nix](https://nixos.org) (requires `extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to be enabled)
- [MacSKK](https://github.com/mtgto/macSKK) (macOS only)

## üöÄ Quick Start

> [!Warning]
> When deploying, files in the `$HOME` and `~/.config` directories will be overwritten. Make sure to back up any important files to avoid data loss.

### Deploy Without Installation (macOS)

```shell
nix run github:s3igo/dotfiles <host_name>
```

### Full Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   nix run github:s3igo/dotfiles#clone
   ```

2. Deploy the configuration:
   ```shell
   nix run ~/.dotfiles#deploy
   ```

## üõ† Usage

Here are some common commands you can use:

```shell
# Update flake inputs and commit the lock file
nix flake update --commit-lock-file

# Deploy system configuration (equivalent to `nix run .#deploy`)
, deploy

# Delete previous configurations
, wipe-history

# Show differences from the previous version
, versions

# Install SKK dictionaries
, install-skk-dicts

# Clean up SKK dictionaries
, cleanup-skk-dicts
```

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `home/`: Contains configuration files for various tools and applications
- `modules/`: Nix modules for system configuration
- `packages/`: Custom Nix packages
- `neovim-config/`: Neovim configuration files (independent flake, can be referenced as `github:s3igo/dotfiles?dir=neovim-config`)
