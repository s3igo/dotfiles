# dotfiles

This repository contains shell configurations, a list of tools and applications to be installed, and their settings. It is designed to provide a reproducible environment when migrating machines and to maintain a history of the machine's configuration.

> **Note**
> By default it contains my configuration for [git](config/mac/HOME/.config/git/config.op), [ssh](config/mac/HOME/.ssh/config), etc., so please rewrite it accordingly.

## Design philosophy

This repository is organized according to the following principles.

- **Simple**  
    This keeps the code base of the script small and provides an effective management with a simple functionality. This also helps to reduce maintenance costs.
- **Portable**  
    The configuration is portable and can be used on any machine. In particular, the focus is on ease of use inside a Docker container.
- **Small**  
    To minimize dependencies, only carefully selected packages are used.

## Requirements

Intended for installation on Mac or Linux.

- bash
- git
- zsh(Optional)  
Required to use [configured zsh plugins](config/common/HOME/.config/sheldon/plugins.toml)
- curl(Optional)  
Required to perform a [Quick install](#quick-installation) or to install [Homebrew âŽ‹](https://brew.sh/) on a Mac.
- GNU make(Optional)  
Required to run the [`make` commands](#usage) described below.

## Installation

Follow the [Quick install](#quick-installation) or [Manual install](#manual-installation) instructions.

> **Warning**
> During installation, files in the `config` directory will overwrite files in your home directory. Please keep files in a safe place if you do not want them to be overwritten.

> **Note**
> [Manual installation](#manual-installation) is recommended if you want to customize and manage using git.

### Quick installation

```shell
curl -L sh.s3igo.me | bash
```

### Manual installation

```shell

# 1. download
$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

# 2. install
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ make install
```

## Usage

### Major commands


```shell
# run `make init` and `make link`
$ make install

# run `make cli` and `make gui`
$ make tools

# run `make update` and `make dump`

$ make cli

# install apps with GUI based on `package` directory
$ make gui

### Internal command

```shell
# set current profile to `PROFILE` variable
$ make profile
```

## Features

### Profile

Multiple profiles are supported.
This feature is currently only supported on Macs and allows for environment differences
from machine to machine by creating a directory with the same name as the profile in `packages/mac`.

The profile can be modified by placing an `.env` file in the project root,
and its behavior follows the flowchart below.


```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A([Start]) --> B[`.env` exists]
    B -->|Yes| C[Profile is set in `.env`]
    B -->|No| D[There is a profile that matches `$ hostname -s`]
    C -->|Yes| E([Use the profile set in `.env`])
    C -->|No| F([Use the profile set in `.env.example`])
    D -->|Yes| G([Use the profile that matches `$ hostname -s`])
    D -->|No| F
```
