# Dotfiles

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains my personal dotfiles - a collection of shell configurations, tools, applications, and their settings. It's designed to provide a reproducible environment when moving between machines and to maintain a history of my machine's configuration.

## üåü Features

- Shell configurations (Fish, Zsh)
- Nix-based package management
- Reproducible environment setup
- macOS and Linux support
- SKK (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion) dictionary management

## üéØ Design Principles

- **Simplicity**: The codebase is kept small to ensure effective management and maintainability, reducing maintenance costs.
- **Portability**: The configuration is portable and can be used across different machines, with special attention given to ease of use in Docker containers.
- **Minimalism**: Only carefully selected packages are used to minimize dependencies.

## üîß Requirements

- [Nix](https://nixos.org) (requires `extra-experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to be enabled)
- [MacSKK](https://github.com/mtgto/macSKK) (macOS only)

## üöÄ Quick Start

> [!Warning]
> When deploying, files in the `$HOME` and `~/.config` directories will be overwritten. Please back up your important files before proceeding to prevent data loss.
